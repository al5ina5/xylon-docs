# Xylon Launch Stratgey

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of Xylon, the innovative and decentralized identity data protocol that puts users in control of their digital identities. The launch will unfold in a series of progressive phases, allowing early supporters and developers to engage with the protocol before it reaches the public.

To kickstart the journey, we will release comprehensive developer-oriented documentation and a Medium article providing insights into the vision, features, and implementation details of Xylon. This step aims to foster transparency and engage the developer community, encouraging feedback and collaboration.

## Beta Launch

#### Closed Beta on Fantom

The next milestone involves the closed beta launch of Xylon on the Fantom network. During this phase, a limited number of participants will gain exclusive access to test and experience the protocol's functionalities firsthand. As part of this beta test, we will hold a special NFT sale, offering 500 unique Xylon NFTs for purchase at a price of 150 FTM each. These NFTs will serve as early supporter badges, granting beta access on Fantom and showcasing the support received from the community.

At Xylon, we deeply appreciate the support and enthusiasm from our community, and we recognize the value of each NFT sold during our special NFT sales. Your participation in these NFT sales not only grants you exclusive early access and unique Xylon characters but also plays a crucial role in supporting our team of dedicated developers and ensuring the continuous growth and evolution of the Xylon protocol.

We greatly value the support and enthusiasm of our Fantom users during the beta phase. As a token of appreciation, Fantom users who participate in the closed beta and acquire Xylon NFTs will be given priority access to the upcoming NFT sale on the Ethereum network. This exclusive opportunity ensures that our loyal community members can secure their place in the Ethereum closed beta and access Xylon's full potential across both Fantom and Ethereum ecosystems.

#### Priority Access to Ethereum Launch for Fantom Users

Following the successful beta test on Fantom, we have ambitious plans to bring Xylon to the Ethereum blockchain. A new closed beta will be organized, allowing select users to explore Xylon's potential on the Ethereum network. As with the previous NFT sale, we will unveil another exciting NFT offering, featuring unique and artistically crafted Xylon characters. Further details about the Ethereum closed beta and the NFT sale will be announced in due course.

## Public Launch

Once we have garnered invaluable insights and fine-tuned the protocol through the closed beta phases, we will proceed with the public launch of Xylon. This milestone will mark the protocol's full-scale deployment on both the Fantom and Ethereum networks, making it accessible to the general public.

As we approach each launch phase, we will keep the community informed about our progress, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in the development journey. We value the active participation and feedback from our users and supporters, which are essential in making Xylon a robust and user-centric solution for decentralized identity data management.

Join us on this exciting journey, and together, let's redefine the future of digital identity with Xylon!
